# Tiny Android Template

Requirements:
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Android SDK

Does Not Require:
* Android Studio
* Gradle
* Apache Ant

The scripts are written in Bash, though it should be relatively simple to port them to another language.

As long as your JDK version is >= 8, this should work. Tested with OpenJDK 13.0.2.
In order to get the Android SDK, you may need to download Android Studio, that is unless you can find the relevant packages within https://dl.google.com/android/repository/

This template is heavily based off https://github.com/authmane512/android-project-template
